/**
 * Reduced-help mode ("Kommissar"): instead of the full candidate intersection,
 * each clue marks only what it REFERENCES on the board — the player draws the
 * conclusion. The marks stay deliberately quiet: one consistent "outline the
 * reference, never wash a whole area" language (matching room outlines + object
 * rings, which players already read well). Marks of all clues are shown side by
 * side (no intersection):
 *
 * - row/col, outside/inside, wall, corner, same line as an object →
 *   a dashed outline around that region (each clue's region traced on its own,
 *   so two overlapping areas stay legible) — never a filled wash
 * - object references (on/beside X, same line/room as X, direction from X, …) →
 *   only the object cells, as a dashed "chalk" ring
 * - in-room (incl. alone/not alone) → the room's outline only
 * - beside a window/door → the window/door symbols themselves light up
 * - NEGATED clues mark the same reference in red ("not here")
 *
 * Relational/social clues (depend on other people) mark nothing — exactly as
 * in full mode, where their candidateCells are null.
